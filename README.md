This is a learning experience for me, all the code and knowledge is taken from https://www.youtube.com/@RyiSnow. ありがとうRyiSnow先生。<3
(Specifically, the series https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om59cwR7psI&list=PL_QPQmz5C6WUF-pOQDsbsKbaBZqXj4qSq which i have NOT YET FINISHED)
I am doing this study to learn game design for my L2 (second year) Info (CS) course!
The game this is for is in my projects, under the very original name "Java Game".

I coded this in VSCode, no external libraries used.
